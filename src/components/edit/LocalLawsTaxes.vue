      Most cities have rules covering venue sharing, and the specific
      codes and ordinances can appear in many places(such as zoning,
      building, licensing or tax codes). In most places you must register
      to get a permit or obtain a license before you list your property
      or accept guests. You may also be resposible for collecting and
      remitting taxes. In some places venue sharing may be prohibited.

      Since you are responsible for your own decision to list or book,
      should get comfortable with the applicable rules before listing on
      .shh. To get you started we offer some <a>helpful resources</a> under
      'Your City Laws'

      By accepting our Terms of Service and listing your space, you certify
